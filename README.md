# Heart failure prediction
A weakened heart pumping ability leads to gradual illness to death depending on amount of time someone lives without proper bloodflow. Cardiovascular diseases is the top cause of death in America. We wanted to show strength of presence of certain habits and lifestyles in a population of those who died by heart failure and a group who did not die of the condition. Download the PowerPoint to see percentages by both groups for each factor or condition.

This might be a disease of accumulated factors that creeps up over time. Heart failure affects people  in the range of 50-73 years of age most.

People with anemia had a 7% higher chance of dying.

People with diabetes were not as represented in the group who died as those without diabetes.

More people who died had high blood pressure.

More non-smokers lived but that doesn't discount that 31% of smokers died.

Ejection fraction is a percent of possible blood circulated out of the heart with each pump. Those who lived had a higher median on the upper range of healthy with a small advantage of 5% more juice over those who didn't make it.

It was hard to say that comorbidity was strongly related to death because it was as strongly correlated with living, or, only a few healthy people did not have more than one of the above factors, older age, anemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking habit, lower ejection fraction, and a few more factors off the notes like higher sodium and decreased muscle health.

Men had a 50-50 chance of dying by heart failure was gender. Many people do not think women die of heart disease. As an aside, American media does not feature the ends of women's lives as often as men's so that is the idea people who watch television or read have.
